    "In this notebook, we're going to walk through the steps of a calculating the likelihood of a genetic distance between two sequences under the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution. In the case of Jukes-Cantor, the probability of change (or no change) given a distance (_t_, in expected number of changes per site) has an analytical derivation (see Yang, Chapter 1). As with most phylogenetic analyses, we will be taking advantage of the assumption that each site evolves independently.  "
